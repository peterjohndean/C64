# C64 - Commodore Systems

## Preface
I’ve recently rekindled my interest in both assembly language programming and electronics. To explore these worlds, I’m looking for a retro-style system that can support both. Since the Commodore 64 Ultimate (C64U) is being released, the choice was easy. I never had a C64, so I’m excited about the challenges ahead. However, since it will be a while before I get the C64U, I’m hoping the C64 Mini is available in stores by December 2025. In the meantime, I might be able to tinker with that.


## Setup
1. Hardware
	a. Waiting for the shipment (and delivery) of the C64U.
	b. So for the time being emulation via VICE on a macOS
	
2. Primary System
	a. macOS M2
	b. VICE. [VICE](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io)
	c. ACME Assembler. [ACME](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/)
	d. BBEdit. (macOS App Store)
	
3. Technical Sources
	Reading, experimenting with trial and error.
	a. Internet Archive. [ARCHIVE](https://archive.org)
	b. Forums, etc.
	
## Notes
- None to speak of at this stage.
